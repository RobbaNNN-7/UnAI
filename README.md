## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **ChromaDB**
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**
- **PyPDFLoader**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Document Parsing**: University PDFs are loaded from the `Books/` directory. Metadata is stored in JSON files under `metadata/`.
2. **Vectorization**: Documents are embedded and stored in **ChromaDB** with metadata.
3. **Query Pipeline**:
   - User submits a query (e.g., "What is QAU's fee structure?")
   - System retrieves top matching documents
   - The context is passed to an LLM
   - A response is generated based on the actual content

## 🧪 Example Query

```bash
> Who is the rector of NUST?

> 🛠️ Currently supports:
> - National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)
> - Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)
> - Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU)

More universities will be added soon.
